# AJAX_based_Web_Application
In this repository, I have converted all my code from servlets, JSP tags, and tag handlers to a tag-free or AJAX based web application in which I am using JSON to send and receive the response. 
The web application looks the same as the previous MVC web app, but it is quite efficient in functionality.
Although I am using servlets and JSPs, I am not using any tags or tag handlers.
This web application is developed using AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)
Prior to this web app, when I needed to forward a request to any other file, a new page needed to be loaded, but now only a specific portion of the web page is reloaded. 
That's the difference and benefit of using AJAX style.
Using JSON made it super easy to send the data as a response; otherwise, a lot of hassle would need to be done for parsing the data.
And even after parsing data, if the parser is contained by your data, then it is again a problem, so it is best to use JSON.

I enjoyed myself a lot while developing this web application.
